TracketyTrack is a simple tool for keeping track of user stories and their status. One main feature is the support for PairProgramming.
It is designed with small teams (such as students working on a project) in mind that want to keep track of their progress but can not have a "real" storyboard with sticky notes etc. as students usually don't have an office.
Moreover it could be used by distributed teams or teams that want a simple electronical record of their progress.
TracketyTrack can also be used to generate simple statistics such as a burndown chart.
