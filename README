# TracketyTrack
## What is it?
TracketyTrack is a simple tool for keeping track of user stories and their status. One main feature is the support for PairProgramming. The name was inspired by [hacketyhack] (hackety-hack.com).
It is designed with small teams (such as students working on a project) in mind that want to keep track of their progress but can not have a "real" storyboard with sticky notes etc. as students usually don't have an office.
Moreover it could be used by distributed teams or teams that want a simple electronical record of their progress.
TracketyTrack can also be used to generate simple statistics such as a burndown chart.

## Attention Under Development
TracketyTrack is totally under development and not yet ready for use. A first really usable and polished version will ikely be available on the 11.01.12 (that's the day we have our final presentation)
